# API CRUD USING GOLANG & MONGODB

I have configured this resource with mongodb and logging.

Kindly do the installation here [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/). For database, kindly adjust on the DNS in the lib/config.go file

For logging I use [Zerolog](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rs/zerolog)

For http server I use [GIN](https://gin-gonic.com/)
